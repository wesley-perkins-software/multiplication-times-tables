# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve Multiplication Times Tables! This project is a static site, so contributions should keep the site fast, simple, and SEO-friendly.

## Run locally
1. Start a local server from the repo root:
   ```sh
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```
2. Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

## Branches and pull requests
- Create a short-lived feature branch from `main`.
- Keep changes focused and easy to review.
- Open a PR with a clear summary and screenshots only when visual changes are made.

## Style rules
- Keep pages static (no build tooling or frameworks).
- Keep URLs stable (do not rename folders or change trailing-slash routes).
- Keep SEO tags consistent (unique `<title>`, meta description, and canonical URL per page).

Thanks again for contributing!

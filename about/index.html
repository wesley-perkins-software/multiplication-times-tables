              <h2>Why this site exists</h2>
              <p>
                This site was created to make multiplication practice simple, fast, and encouraging. It helps learners build confidence
                by focusing on one question at a time without extra distractions.
              </p>

              <h2>Who it’s for (students/parents/teachers)</h2>
              <p>
                Students can practice independently, parents can support quick homework review, and teachers can use it for warmups or
                centers. It’s designed to be kid-friendly and easy to use on any device.
              </p>

              <h2>How to use it</h2>
              <p>
                Choose mixed practice or a specific times table, answer each question, and try to build a streak. Short daily sessions are
                a great way to improve recall over time.
              </p>

              <h2>How streaks work (current vs longest)</h2>
              <p>
                Your current streak shows how many questions you’ve answered correctly in a row during this session. Your longest streak is
                the best run you’ve achieved on this device and can help you track progress over time.
              </p>
